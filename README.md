## About this ProjectðŸ¤”:
This project is a ChatGPT-Clone which interacts in a conversational way. It returns answers to the queries asked and generates a response/answer.

## Features:
   
   * Text Generation: This clone involves an interactive chatting interface using which the user can chat with the AI model and get the necessary information.
   * Image Generation: Visual representation of the text is one of the best ways to a proper idea of the text. To achive this, this project alos includes a image generation feature along with text. For every question asked by the user, the answer includes an image related to the question.
   * Changing Models: There are tons of AI models developed by OpenAI which are trained to work differently for different purposes. If one is good at reading and returning answers as text, the other is more efficient at analaysing and returning code. So, the user can also change the models and work with whichever one is suitable for his/her purpose of using the app.
   * Voice Assistant: A voice assistant feature is also included in this project. Just click the blue button in the right bottom corner and start speaking. All you questions will be answered back in the form of voice using Alan API.
